### projected gradient descent

results for PGD
- use vanilla analysis and trangular inequality
- not obvious, but we do make progress every step

### coordinate descent

x_t+1 = x_t - gamma_t Nabla_i f(x_t) e_i
- strong convexity -> PL inequality with the same mu
    - detach x*, get a quadratic bound
    - PL strictly weaker than strong convexity: f(x1, x2) = x1^2
    - some inequality
- coordinate-wise smoothness
    - smooth -> coordinate-wise smoothness with the same lambda
