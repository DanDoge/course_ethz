### SGD

E f(x^hat_T) - f(x*) <= (R^2 + B^2 sum gamma_t^2) / 2 sum gamma_t
- x^hat_T = sum gamma_t x_t / sum gamma_t
- for strongly convex < Nabla F(x_t), x_t - x*> >= mu |x_t - x*|^2
    - from F(X) >= F(y) + partial + square distance
    - and  F(y) >= F(X) + partial + square distance
- 1/t convergence rate is a tight bound
- for constant step size
    - refer to slides for details
    - for sigma=0 -> linear convergence to optimal
