### convex functions

optim: min f(x) s.t. x in X
- term.: objective function, feasible solutions, minimum/minimizer
- for convex f and X, optimization error for arbitraty eps can be achieved by stepvise update
- spectral norm |A| = max_|v|=1 |Av|
- mean value theorom: exists c in (a, b) s.t. h'(c) = (h(b) - h(a)) / (b - a)
- convex set
- convex function
    - min convex function in convex set, every local minimum is global minimum
    - convergence rate: f(x_t) - f(x*) = O(f(t))
    - iff epi(f) is convex set
    - convexity of norm
    - f convex and dom(f) is open -> f is continuous
