### newton method

secant method
- x_t+1 = x_t - f(x_t) / f'(x_t)
    - finite approximation of f'(x_t)
- then apply it to optimization: second derivative free version in 1 dim.
- generalize to higher dims? Hessian free?
    - d-dim secant condition: nabla f(x_t) - nabla f(x_t-1) = H_t (x_t - x_t-1)
    - quasi newton method
    - d=1, solution is unique
    - d > 1: infinitely many symmetric solutons
        - dim of solution spaces: d choose 2
    - makes sense to have H_t ~ H_t-1
- BFGS
    -
