### convexity

f(y) > f(x) + deltaf(x)t (y - x) <-> f convex
- <-, definition of convexity
- ->, f(x) > f(z) + deltaf(z)t (x - z) f(y) > f(z) + deltaf(z)t (y - z)
    - a linear conbination of the above two will yield answer.
- f convex iff dom(f) is convex, and for x in dom(f), delta^2 f(x) >= 0
- operations preserve convexity: max f_i, positive linear operation, convex Â° affine 
    - e^f(x)
- local minima -> global minima
- critical point(deltaf(x) = 0) -> global minimum
    - convex quadratic functions minimized by linear equations
    - solving a critical point is always a system of equations
- strictly convex -> at most one global minimum
- x* minimizer iff delta f(x*)t (x - x*) >= 0
- alpha-sublevel set of f {f(x) <= alpha}
    - exist a numempty and bounded sublevel set -> f has a global minimum
- lagrange duality
    - L = f_0(x) + sum lambda_i f_i(x) + sum v_i h_i(x)
    - g = inf_x L
- lagrange are lower bounds on primal functions
    - max g s.t. lambda >= 0
    - dual is convex program even if primal is not
    - strong lagrange duality: Slater point exists -> inf f_0(x) = max g(lambda, v)
