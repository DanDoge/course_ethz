### Frank-Wolfe algorithm

constrained optim.
- PDG: projection onto X
- Frank-Wolfe: linear optim. over X
    - easier often the case
    - linear mim. oracle argmin_z in X g^T z
    - x_0 in X, loop: s = LMO(nabla f(x_t)), x_t+1 = (1 - gamma_t) x_t + gamma_t s
    - for conv of set of points, then LMO always achieves min at one of the points
- some examples of LMO, not sure where they come from though
- upper bound for optimality gap
