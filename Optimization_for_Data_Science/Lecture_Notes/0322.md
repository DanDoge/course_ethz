### subgradient methods

- relative interior
    - {x | exists a ball B(x, r) s.t. its intersection with Affine space X lies in, is in X}
        - otherwise a line in 2D space will have interior empty
- subgradient for conic combinaiton and affine tsfm, pointwise maximum
    - pointwise maximum: part h(x) = conv hull of {part f_i(x)}
- negative subgradient may not be descent direction
    - but g^t (x* - x) <= f(x*) - f(x) <= 0
    - x_t+1 = Pi_X(x_t - gamma_t g_t)
        - using trianglular inequality
        - refer to slides
        - bounds for min / avg iterate
