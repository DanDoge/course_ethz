### subgradient

for non-smooth and non-differentiable f
- non-smooth: not differentiable, or diff.able but gradient not Lipschitz cont.
- g is subgradient of f at x if f(y) > f(x) + g^t (y - x)
- part f is the subdifferential, the set of subgradients of f at x
- part f in {Nable f(x)} if f is diff.able at x
- convex f have subgradient for all x in relative interior
- dom(f) convex, subgradient exists everywhere -> f convex
- convex f diff.able a.w.
- convex: Lipschitz cont. <-> bounded subgradients
