### newton's method and quasi neuton method

x_t+1 = x_t - f(x_t) / f'(x_t)
- searching for zero of derivative: x_t+1 = x_t - f''(x_t)^-1  f'(x_t)
- or more generally, x_t+1 = x_t - H(x_t) nabla f(x_t)
- only have local convergence
    - starting close to the global min, converge in loglog (1 / eps) steps
    - also coenverge to close critical point
