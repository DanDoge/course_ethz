### non convex functions

GD for nonconvex functions
- stuck in subble point or go to infinity
- smoothness, concave
- bounded hessian -> smooth
- smooth -> bounded hessians for open sets
- GD for smooth functions: ||nabla f(x_t)|| to 0
    - may not converge to critical point
- in smoothing setting and 1/L step size, GD cannot overshoot
