# background review

predicates?

prob theory
- indicate var.

linear algebra
- affine transformations: translation + linear transformation

prediction
- consistency: f_n(X) -> Y if sample size n -> infty
  - the choise of f_n(X) -> Y depends on the task
  - usually defined by a loss function
    - defined on a distance function
    - shape of the distance function determines how difficult to find the true fucntion
  - f is from a model space
- true risk not available
  - min. emperical risk
