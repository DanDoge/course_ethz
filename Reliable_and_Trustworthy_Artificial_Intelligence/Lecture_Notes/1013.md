### certification with complete methods

MILP: mixed integer linear program
- complete but with NP-complete cost
- improve with Box bounds -> faster and still complete
- definition
  - min sum of c_i x_i
  - s.t. Ax <= b, l < x < u, some x_i are integers (or even binary)
- encoding the affine layer
  - y = Wx + b
- ReLU
  - y <= x - l (1 - a)
  - y >= x
  - y <= u a
  - y >= 0
  - a in {0, 1}
  - number of crossing zero also matters: smaller faster
- precondition
  - x\`- eps < x < x\`+ eps
- postcondition
  - min o_0 - o_1
- MILP instance
  - min o_0 - o_1
  - s.t. affine and ReLU encodings, pre-computed box bounds on all neurons in each layer(speedup using incomplete method), bounds on input neurons, a in {0, 1} from ReLU encoding
