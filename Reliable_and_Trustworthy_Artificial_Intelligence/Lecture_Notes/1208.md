### certified and fair machine learning

removing sensitive features does not work
- correlation with other features

individual fariness
- decisions of model given similar points should be similar
- group fairness
    - p(y | G = g_i) = p(y | G = g_j)

enforcing fairness
- pre processing: input data -> debiased data, modular
    - data producer: given input point x and a set of similar individuals, maps to a similar region in the latent space
    - bound the region with a tightest box
    - data consumer: all points  with N(z, box) are classified to the same class
- input similarity: phi: R^n * R^n -> {0, 1}, S_phi(x) = {x'; phi(x, x') = 1.}
- e2e goal: E_x~D mu(M(x), M(x')) for all x' in S_phi(x)
    - for all points similar to x, M(x) = h_phi f_theta (x), should be somehow similar or not (in {0, 1})
    - (DL2) translate L(phi -> omega)
        - find worse case violations x* = argmin_(x' in S_phi(x)) L(Â¬ (phi -> omega))(x, x')
        - enforce the omega on these adv examples min_theta L((phi -> omega))(x, x*)
    - compute radius eps s.t. f_theta(S_phi(x)) in B_infty(z, eps)
        - MILP
    - certifying robustness
        - again, use MILP to verity with data consumer model trained using e.g. PGD

statistical aspects of group fairness aware learning
- classifier h: X -> Y from dataset S = {(x_i, a_i, y_i)}
- per instance protected attribute
- ensure h does not discriminate w.r.t. a
    - on population level w/o individual guarantees
- fairness through unawareness? correlated features
- demographic parity: distribution (h(x), a, y)
    - h(x) independent with a
    - when a and y are correlated -> h(x) and y are not correlated?
- equalized odds: h(x) independent with a given y
- equality of opportunity h(x) independent with a given y = 1
- mesurement: accuracy, fairness deviation measure
    - only empirical estimates available
- PAC learning: w.h.p. worst case error is bounded by O(sqrt(1 / n * tao))
    - tao is the min_a P(Y = 1, A = a)
- learn from corrupted data
    - malicious adv model: randomly access some data, corrupt: mapping from S_clean to S_poisson
    - goal: study R(L(S_poisson)) and D(L(S_poisson))
        - assume the worst case: adv knows Learner, formulation of D and S_clean
    - results: for all corruption ratil alpha, tao, exists (H, D, A) s.t. with prob > 0.5, R(L(S_poisson)) - R(h*) > alpha, delta D > alpha / (2 tao)
