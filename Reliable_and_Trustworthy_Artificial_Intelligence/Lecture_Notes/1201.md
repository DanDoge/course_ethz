### geometric transformations

geometric transformations
- rotation, translation, scaling
    - non-integer indices: bilinear interpolation
    - compute preimage of points under transformation, interpolate to obtain pixel value
        - I_K(x, y) = I(T_K^-1(x, y))
- convex relixation of R_phi(O)
    - baseline: Box relexation
    - w_l kappa + b_l < I_kappa(x, y) < w_u kappa + b_u
    - measure of tightness: generalize area to volume
        - L = int I - w_l k - b_l d k
        - goal find w and b that min. L and U volume s.t. the soundness constraints holds
            - MC approx -> may lead to unsoundness!
            - shift bias to reach soundness
                - given that the constrains holds for some points
                - we get a maximum soundness violation on entire parameter space
                    - w k + b_new - I(x, y) < delta
                    - box propagation to obtain l
                    - or using mean value theorem and Lipschitz continuity
                        - where does the Lipschitz constant come from?
                            - push through Box
        - refine bounds via refinement: splitting region into smaller parts
