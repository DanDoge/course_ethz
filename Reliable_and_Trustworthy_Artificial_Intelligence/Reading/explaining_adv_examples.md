## EXPLAINING AND HARNESSING ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES

L-BFGS: limited memory quasi neuton method
- estimate inverse hessian

hypotheses
- NN are too linear to resist linear adv perturbations

RBF: radial basis function
- output = sum of a_i exp(-beta_i |x - c_i|^2)

why adv examples generalize
- hypothesize all NN ensemble the same linear classifier
- so ensembles also do not work
