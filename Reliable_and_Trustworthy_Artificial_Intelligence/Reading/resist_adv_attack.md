## Towards Deep Learning Models Resistant to Adversarial Attacks

to be adv robust, network should have more capacity

defend
- specify a attack model
- saddle point problem?
  - local maxima within x + S tend to have well-concentrated losses
  - not only in the direction of grad will we find adv examples, but also in the opposite direction

- danskin`s theorem
