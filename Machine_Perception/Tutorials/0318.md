BPTT
- problematic in Pi part h_j / part h_j-1
    - W^t diag(tanh'(z_j-1))
    - gradient exploding or vanishing
        - LSTM or GRU (no vanishing)
            - LSTM: input gate(information from input), forget gate(forget hidden state based on input), output gate(output), gate gate(tanh activated, multivated with i-gate's output)
                - gradient highway from addition, vanishing gradient for things we forget
        - gradient clipping (no exploding)
