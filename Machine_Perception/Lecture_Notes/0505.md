### 3d human body modeling

mesh registration: register realisti scans to template model
- linear blend skining: t_i_roted = sum_k w_ki G(theta, J) t_i
    - vertex weighted by bones/joints
    - w from artists
- SMPL: t_i_roted = sum_k w_ki G(theta, J(beta)) (t_i + s_i(beta) + p_i(theta))
    - shape corretice Sbeta, pose correctives Ptheta
    - everything inlcuding blend weights are also learned
- learn 3D pose: estimate s, R, T, beta, theta from image
    - body param -> mesh -> joint
    - learned GD: theta_t+1 = theta_t + F(grad, theta_t, x)
        - how to train F, synthetic data
