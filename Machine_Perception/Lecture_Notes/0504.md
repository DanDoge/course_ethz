### human pose estimation

pictorial strucure model
- S = sum phi(I, l_i) + sum ksi(l_i, l_j)
    - ksi: prob of l_i, l_j are for the same person
    - index m -> mixture type for diff. orinetations
    - S(M): co-occurrence bias
- thin slicing model
    - conv feature -> refine by part model
    - energy term for single frame
    - and also for across frames
    - adding information from single frame, neighboring joints, neighboring frames
