### autoregressive models

generative - explicit density - tractable
- increasing prob of good samples immediately supresses bad samples
- tabular approach
    - p(x) = Prod p(x_i | x_1...i-1)
        - 2^n-1 - 1 params ?
- p(x_i | x_1...i-1) = Ber(f(x_1...i-1)), ordering can be random. but fixed
    - choise of f: sigmoid(alpha^T x), fully visible sigmoid belief netwokrs
        - #of params: O(n^2)
    - NADE: each conditional modeled bythe same NN
        - teacher forcing: take GT as conditions during training
    - MADE: mask out some edges in AE
        - sample an ordering, and connect to all nodes with lower indices
