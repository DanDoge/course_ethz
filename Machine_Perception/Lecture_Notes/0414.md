### GAN

GAN objective
- assuming fixed G, BCE loss for D
    - sum y log D(x) + (1 - y) log (1 - D(x))
    - since half of samples are real and others fake
    - D* = argmin -.5 (E_x log(D(x)) + E_z log(1 - D(G(z))))
    = argmax (drop -.5)
- and define G* to foll any D
- for optimal D
    - assume G(z) covers x, use law of unconsciencious stat.
    - for log(1 - D(G(z))), gradient around 0 is small
        - D* is not desired
- global optimum is achieved at p_data = p_model
- given enough capacity, D allowed = D*, and p_model is updated to improve V(p_model, D*)
    - then p_model converges to p_data
- mode collapse: unroll GAN
- JS divergence: saturates at 1(no overlapping support)
    - Wasserstein GAN
