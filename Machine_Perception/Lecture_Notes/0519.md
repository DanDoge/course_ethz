### reinforcement learning

TD learnig
- SARSA: on policy
- q-learning: off-policy
- biased due to bootstraping

deep q-networks
- SGD update with correlated states
    - replay buffer
    - off-policy allows for using old samples

policy gradients
- p(tau) = p(s_1) Prod pi(a_t |s_t) p(s_t+1 | a_t, s_t)
- REINFORCE
- actor-critic
