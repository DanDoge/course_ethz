### multiview stereo matching

stereo geometry
- F = t_x, t = (1, 0, 0)
- d: disparity, B/Z = d/f
  - d d / d Z = Bf/Z^2, accurary ~ a pixel of uncertainty, d Z: error in distance estimate
  - good in near range

basic idea
- project back points and choose one depth iwth min error
  - search on (half) epilolar line:
- ill constrained
  - uniform regions, half-occluded pixels
  - consistency test
  - scene constraints: ordering from plain surface
    - enforce ordering under occlusion: ignore occluded things or ignore object
  - uniqueness
  - disparity constraint
  - --> DP
  - disparity map: # of pixel shift for corrsponding pixels
  - semi-global optim. not only the scan line(what DP does), but whole image --> not doable
    - consider multiple lines, add cost for inconsistency
    - propagate forward in ecery directions, including diagonal/vertical paths
  - energy min.: min. disparity changes
  - graph cut: labeling problem, labeling --> graph cut
- rectification: epipolar line are parallel
