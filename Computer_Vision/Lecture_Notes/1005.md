### optical flow

estimate moton of each pixel
- consistant lighting, small motion$- brightness constancy equation
- possible solution resides on a line
- horn schunck: smooth flow
  - min velosity gradients --> also a linear system
- lucas kanade: local constant flow
  - harris corner detector in normal equations --> only corner can be solved best
