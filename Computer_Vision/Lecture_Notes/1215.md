### stereo

projective trans --> epipolar line --> horizontal scanlines, epipole to (1, 0, 0)
- if epiploe in image -- strong distortion

baseline
- large: good conditioning, good accuracy, hard to match, more occlusions

plain sweep multiview matching
- reproject to hypothesized plane

volumetric graph cut
- outer/inner surface, find a surface as a graph cut
- photoconsistency as a cost to voxels
- discard cam outside outer sirface: occlusion
- nromalized cross correlation: more cresp than SSD, better than SSD

space carving: visibility first
- choose voxel on the surface(visibility guaranteed), project and correlate, not consistant --> remove
- catastrophic wrong: error propagate

NeRF
- volume rendering, soft decision, not only the first voxel
