### ransac

Poission approx. of rare events
- lambda=3: 3 times more sample --> 0.05 still not happening
- stop when ratio of inliners are as expected
  - or adaptively starting from infty and then correct samples
- for F: 1 or 3 solutions per sample --> validate all of them
  - then look for additional matches --> refine
    - s.t. if we match on the part of image, and another part is mroe wrong, we can do a trade off
- LMedS: min. median residual in stead of max. inlier count, 50% inlier
  - for close images, inlier much, but in general not sure how much t oexpect
  - but error can be expected, e.g. 2pixel
- ransac will prefer degenerate data: as long as points on plane are correct, otherthings does not matter, or repeating structure
  - squeeze spaces until no inliers exist, fit a plane -> fit a line
