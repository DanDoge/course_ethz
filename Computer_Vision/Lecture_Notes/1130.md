### multiview geometry

project conic to cone
- Q = P^T C P
- project to quadric P Q^* P^T

direct linear transform
- x = P X up to scale, [x]_x P X = 0, rank2 matrix
  - 2by12 matrix
  - P 11 DoF, 5.5 points, SVD for over determined things
- degeneerate cases: points on plane/single line passing projection center
  - or camera points on cubic
- normalize: center of mass to origin, scale
- DLT on lines: l^T P X = 0, 2 eq for a line
- geometric error
  - sum d(x, PX)^2
  - gold standard algorithm: n>=6 corrs., normalize, DLT, min geometric error
- restricted camera: min geo. error: through parametrization
  - or DLT, then clamp to 0
  - or DLT and then increasing weights
- image of absolute conic
  - project the abs. conic, independent of cam. extrinsics

two viw geometry
- q: given x, x'? given x -- x', P and P'? given x -- x, p -- p', X?
- epipolar geometry
  - epipoles: baseline with image plane/vanishing point of cam motion direction
  - epipolar plane, plane containing baseline
- mapping from point to line: fundamental matrix
  - F = [e]_x H = [e]_x P' P+, if C = C'
  - x'^T F x = 0, 7DoF rank2 and up to scale
  - invariant to projective 3-space(cam and space both changes)
    - and that is the only ambiguity
    - if fundamental mat is uniquely determined, scene and cma can be reconstructed up to projective transformation
  - canonical form: F = [m]_x M
- basic equation
  - one point --> one eq., 8point
  - rank2: 7points and F  = F1 + lambda F2, let det F = 0, 1 or 3 sol.
