### epopolar geometry

calibrated case
- know pixel --> ray directions
- essential matrix: [t_x] R, t: OO', R: rotation of another matrix
  - again, scale is not observable, 2 + 3 DoG
  - 5-point relative motion --> solution in 4 dim space: scale does not matter, -1
  - det E = 0, EE^T E - trace(EE^T) E / 2 = 0 --> 10 cubis polynomials
    - up to 10 solutions
  - with vertical direction estimated --> 3 DoF rotation things remain
- two view geometry: only look points on the epipolar line

triangulation
- two views: backprojection and triangulation
  - solve and rescale --> geometry error
- three views: correlated constrains: epipolar constraints
  - trifocal plane: two epilolar lines are the same, something is missing in essential/foundamental matrix
- point as intersection of row and column
  - rewrite things, for 3 views, 2, 1, 1 per image, also not axis-aligned possible
  - counting argument, 11 * n - 15, 11 DoF per projection(3by4 - 1) and remove 15 projective ambiguity
  - for 4 views, one line per image
  - 2 constraints per point for perspective camera, but for radial camera one constraint per feature
    - only the line feature is sure, 4 images for a point, 15 points
    - for pure rotation, the world is effectively 2D panorama, easier
- affine camera: drop 0001 in projection matrix and also the origin point(1 in xyz1)
  - origin as the center of gravity
