### structure from motion

SfM
- affine camera: last row is 0001
  - then subtract reference point
  - cloest rank-3 approx --> MLE (bondle adj.)
  - then from SVD reconstruct ortho. basis (we still have a proepsctive ambiguity)
    - normalize camera: s.t. we have a rotation thing going on
- perspective factorization
  - lambda m = PM
  - rank4 factorization
- standard SfM/sequential
  - two views with F to initialize motion
  - initialize structure
  - extend motion: of points we have the 3D coef, third cam can also be uniquely(up to scaling) determined
  - extend structure: more points visible from multiple camera
- global SfM
  - compute pairwise epipolar geometry
  - compute relative rotations, find consensus in the whole camera graph
  - estimate all positions
  - more efficient, more accurate, less robust
- refine SfM
  - independent error Gaussian
  - non linear least squares
    - newton iteration
    - LM: N = J^t J + lambda diag(J^t J)
      - small lambda: newton
      - large lambda: guaranteed descent, aligned to gradient
      - success: lambda smaller, else lambda larger
      - requires function, start value and compute J
      - hard minimization? parameters large, high correlation/poor conditioning
        - and gauge freedom: 6-7 DoF --> J^t J not full rank
          - fix things by first cam be (0, 0), second dist 1 to first
          - but we cannot move the first cam
    - sparse LM: structured non-zero entries
  - robust error model: outlier rejection

robust model fitting
- m-estimator: minimize a nonlinear function on top of the residual
- ransac: 2points, fit a line
  - fit a line with all good points close to the line --> as a final candidate
  - then choose the best among all candidates
