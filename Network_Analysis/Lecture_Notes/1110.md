allowing transposition -> N(i) in N\[j\], transpose a different neighbor to j

majorization: prefix of edge weight is matched, stronger than sum of weights

lexicographic: every neighbor has to be stronger, no transfer of weights possible, no reuse of neighbors possible   


line of generalization: neighborhood inclusion -> positional dominance -> centrality
