# introduction

phenomenon --abstration--> network concept --representation--> network data
- from abstration is network model
- abstrations: nodes and relations
  - to imply conclusions, reverse the abstration will be needed
- network is a emerging math. discipline
  - math. network science / applied network science / computational network science
- pipeline: problem statement, theory, hypotheses, research design, data collection, exploration and analysis, interpretation and presentation
- objectives: description(as in this course)

what is theory: four questions
- what is the phonomenon
  - antecedents, and consequences
- how are these accociated
- why shoud it be the case
  - to be easy to test
- who, where, when?
  - the context this machenism happens

hypotheses
- e.g. utility increases if other people in the network also use it -> only some e.g. search engines left

research design
- network can be outcome of some conditions or be some conditions of the outcomes
- network analysis: network to explain some outcomes
- network evolution/longitudinal study: co-evolution of structure and behavior
  - homophily: relationship from similar people; social selection, social influence

data collection
- data: values of variables
- values: do not have to be numerical
  - nominal: can equal or not; binary; ordinal: have an order; quantities
  - compositional of values: tuples, distributions, seqnences, time intervals, networks(values are networks)
- variable: mapping from domain(observations, things) to range(potential values)
  - domain: dyadic, time series, vector fields, spatial data, networks
  - networks are data on interceting dyads
- network data: x: D -> X, D in N * A
  - N = A one-mode
  - N and A is empty two-mode
  - structural zeros and absent ties: network is not graph
    - missing data is not known zero
  - the whole table is A network variable
    - note sometimes the diagnal are left empty: no definition on this
- validity: explanation should be accurate, and true
- storing data
  - adjacency matrix
  - adjacency list
  - edge list
  - ego network(N is a single element set)
- graph is A representation of the network

presentation
- how to draw a graph
