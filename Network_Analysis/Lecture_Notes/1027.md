### centrality

... is a property of a node's position in a network
- commonly defined as an index N -> R
  - node -> (non negative) number, can be a number / label
- neighborhood inclusion: N(i) in N\[j\], N\[j\] includes j
  - give a preorder, which does not contradict the degree order(complete)
  - although sparse
  - are there some order in the middle?
    - s.t. it is compatible with neighborhood inclusion, and not too much complete
    - assume higher weight the better
    - position of i (in network x) = set of (outgoing) relationships from i to t with weight x_it
      - first attempt: i <= j if for all k, x_ik <= x_jk, and x_ij <= x_ji
        - with X = {0, 1} and symmetric, we come back to neighborhood inclusion
        - for directed case, N^+(i), outgoing neighbor
