### network structure

questions at macro level
- normal, special, category
- binary network on complete graph(w/o diagnal)
  - G(n): number of simple undirected graphes, 2^(n, 2)
  - G(n) modulo isomophorism: at least G(n) / n!
  - consider number of graphs with the same number of edges in a graph: 1, (n, 2), (n, 2) * ((n, 2) - 1) / 2 , ..., (n, 2), 1
    - most graphs will have half of the edges present
      - for a random graph, highly possible it is dense

graph model
- define a prob measure on the graph set
  - G(n), uniform distribution on all graphs, most graphs will be dense
  - G(n, m), all graphs with n vertices and m edges are equal probable
- or distance from ideal case(e.g. no edges/complete graph), restricted
  - number of edges: # of edits from an isolate graph, but the number of vertices are not considered
  - normalize to average degree, still makes no sense w.r.t. different number of vertices, may still be useful(e.g. number of friendships, tends to be a constant)
  - deg / (n - 1): always falls in [0, 1]
- Bernoulli / Erdös-Rényi / Gilbert model
  - each edge is present with prob p
  - prob(deg(v) = k), binominal distribution -> exponential, if (n - 1) p is constant, as n -> infty
  - note that G(n) is G(n, 0.5)
- scale-free networks
  - a property of deg distributions
  - prob(deg(v) = k) = 1 / k^gamma
  - some nodes has high degree, while most nodes has only 1 or 2
  - created (not only) by preferential attachment: for a newly added node, attach to a existing node with prob proportional to the existing degree
  - (gravity) or by assigning vertex weights, and create edges with prob ~ w1 * w2
