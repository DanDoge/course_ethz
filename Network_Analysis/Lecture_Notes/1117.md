### role

role equivalence
- individuals/nodes behave in the same way (to nodes in another role)
- baseline definition
    - structural equivalence: exact the same neighborhood
        - can split some groups since this is not sufficient condition
        - neighboring nodes cannot in the same group
    - regular equivalence: if neighborhood set equals
        - cannot assign isolate nodes and non-isolate ones in the same group
    - role equivalence relative to ~: neighborhood of i, after a mapping sigma, is in neighborhood of j, the simga in Sigma is build upon some existing relations
        - mapping sigma(i, j): sigma(i, i) contains identical mapping, and close under transitive composition: sigma_ij Â° sigma_jk in Sigma_ik
        - as role evoves, the role assignments falls into cycles or fix points
