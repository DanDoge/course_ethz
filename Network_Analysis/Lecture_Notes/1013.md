### structure

sort vertices by degree
- only a fingerprint, not characterstic
- busket sort, O(n) time
- definition of graphic degree sequences
  - a non-increasing d_1...n is graphic iff exists G with d_i = deg(v_i)
  - sum has to be even
  - iff for all k sum_1...k d_i <= k(k-1) + sum_(k+1)...n min{k, d_j}
    - necessity: the first k vertex can only be connected to themselves or vertex left
    - sufficiency: 
    - O(n) implementation, maintain a pointer where deg_v = k
  - iff d_2 - 1, ..., d_(d_1+1) - 1, d_(d_1+2), ..., d_n is graphic
    - constructive, but only one possible graph is given

core-periphery structure
- G is a split graph if exists a partition V = C + P
  - s.t. C is a clique, and P is an independent set
  - if one of the ineq. are equality, then we have a split graph
- distance towards a split graph -> inconsistencies
  - edges not in the core and in the periphery
  - distance is 0.5 *(h(h - 1) + sum of  d_j - sum of d_i), note edges are counted twice from each vertex
    - h = max{i, d_i >= i - 1} corrected Durfee number
- threshold graph
  - for all first h inequalities, the equality holds
    - again, h = max{i, d_i >= i - 1}
  - also defined by neighborhood inclusion -> iff the preorder(transistive) is total
  - two more difinitions
    - exists a vertex weights V -> R and a threshold s.t. {v, w} in E iff tao(v) + tao(w) > t
    - exist an ordering s.t. the G is obtained by adding vertex as an isolate or universal
    - threshold gap: 0.5 sum of |d_i - d_i| from 1 to h, the corrected conjugate sequence should be symmetric
