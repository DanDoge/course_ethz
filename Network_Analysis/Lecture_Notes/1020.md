aggregating distances
- note taht s != t, and the graph can be directional

torus
- connect grid points with manhaton dist less than r 
- for (n, 1, r) torus: degree constant, clusteirng coef 75%, dist O(n)
  - random short cuts: rewiring some random edges / adding edges
    - cc goes down, but dist drops sharply

counting triangles
- t_2: enumerating all v shapes, subtract triangles
- t_1: enumerating all edge+other point pair, subtract ...
- algorithm: N- is points before v_i in the degree ordering: small to large
  - s.t. v_i is the possible last vertex in the triangle
  - time complexity: note each edge can only be considered as the long edge once(v1, v2, v3 -> long edge will be (v1, v3))
    - and for this long edge, running time will be less than min(deg(v1), deg(v3))?
  - arboricity: avg deg in the densest part / number of forests to cover all edges
