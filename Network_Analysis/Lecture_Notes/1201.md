### role

block modeling
- structural equivalence: exact neighbor -> adjaciency graph will be of block of 0s and 1s (up to a permutation)
    - can collapse nodes in group into a single node
- regular equivalence: all zeros or a 1 in each row/column

clique
- if induced subgraph is complete
- maximal if it is inclusion-maximal, number can be exponential
- clique number: largest clique (maximum clique), omega(G)
    - is still NP hard, reductino from 3-SAT
- deviation from clique: k-cores
    - let delta(G) = min deg(v)
    - k-core of G is the inclusion maximal subgraph with delta(Core_k(G)) >= k
        - i.e. every vertex has an at least k induced degrees
    - lemma: for all k, Core_k(G) is unique, and k>l -> Core_k(G) is in Core_l(G)
    - lemma core(v) < |{w in N(v): core(w) >= core(v)}|
        - from k Core remove all vertices with degree k until convergence -> (k+1) Core

cohesive subgraphs
- max average degree: include vertex with more edges with vertices in this graph
- flow network: if min-cut does not intereset with V -> bottleneck in source -> sink weight too large -> decrease d
    - othervise, increase d
