### clustering

modularity
- Q(C) = sum of 
            (number of edges in cluster) / (number of edges in whole graph) 
            - ((sum of degree) / 2m) ** 2 
    - tradeoff between a single cluster and n cluster
- NP-hard to optimize
    - greedy merging two clusters: Q from -1 to some maxima, then to zero

nested communities
- quasi threshold graphs: universal or isolated vertex or merging two quasi threshold graphs

social circles
- edge weights as the shared social circles the vertices are in
- q(i, j) number of quad strutures including i, j
- rank neighbors by embeddedness of tie, IOU of top k neighbors
