### centrality indices

degree centrality: count degree

clossness centrality: sum of distance inversed
- but if the graph is not connected, every thing is zero
  - if leave out not connected, the basis of sum will be different
- c = r(i) / (n - 1) * (sum of dist / r(i))^-1
  - avg dist among reachable notes
  - times number of nodes reachable
- harmonic closeness: no normalizing, automatic dealing with infty
- radiality: linearity in distance, diam is the largest dist

betweenness centrality: for all pair of nodes, sum ratio of the shortest path passing through the node
- how to calculate: let delta(s, b) = delta(s, t | b)
  - note on pp101, the sum of rows are c_F(s) - 1
  - W(G): total distance, R(G): # of reachable pairs

eigenvector centrality: lambda vec_c = A vec_c, A_ij is j->i
- choose the biggest (absolute) eigen value

all of them perserve neighborhood inclusion preorder
