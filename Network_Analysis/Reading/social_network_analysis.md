# Nerworks, Relations and Structure

networks instead of random samples?
- people/corporation make decision influenced by others, even minic others
- attributes of social actors are a pattern/structure of the relations among actors
  - it's only because, say, blacks and whites occupy
particular kinds of patterns in networks in relation to each other that
"race" becomes an important variable
- fundamental concepts
  - actor, relational tie, dyad(pair and the tie between them), triad(three actorsand the ties among them: translasive, balanced), subgroup, group, relation(collection of ties of a specific kind)
