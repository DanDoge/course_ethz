# Nerworks, Relations and Structure

networks instead of random samples?
- people/corporation make decision influenced by others, even minic others
- attributes of social actors are a pattern/structure of the relations among actors
  - it's only because, say, blacks and whites occupy
particular kinds of patterns in networks in relation to each other that
"race" becomes an important variable
- fundamental concepts
  - actor, relational tie, dyad(pair and the tie between them), triad(three actorsand the ties among them: translasive, balanced), subgroup, group, relation(collection of ties of a specific kind)

  network data
  - structural variables: measures ties of a specific kind
  - composision variables: mestures of actor attributes, defined at the level of individual actors
  - mode: a distinct set of entities, one-mode / two-mode / ... data
    - one-mode networks: actor, relations, actor attributes
    - two-mode networks: two set of actors / one set of actors and a set of events, also we have attributes
    - ego-centered network: a center/ego, and some alters that have a tie with the ego
  - affliation variables: in two-mode networks, one set of actors, one set of events to which the actors belong; defined on a specific subset of actors
  - measurement, (non)directional, dichotomous/valued
  - special network design for special cases
  - longitudinal data collection: study how stable ties are and whether it reaches equilibrium state
