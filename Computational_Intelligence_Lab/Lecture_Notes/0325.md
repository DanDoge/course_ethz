### matrix approximation

rank1 model
- why assmue norm of u v are 1
    - only give up 1 DoF
- sup |Ax|_2 s.t. |x| = sigma_1
- Eckart young: pruning the singular values below sigma_k gets to optimal rank k approximation of the matrix
    - and the squared error is sum_k+1 simga_i^2
- reduced SVD
    - remove U and V that corresponds to zero elements in Sigma
- SVD
    - low rank matrix approx. non convex, not SVD solvable

matrix completion
- SVD with imputation: estimate with mean
    - SVD not doable directly
- no easy fix: weighted Frobenius norm NP-hard, even for k = 1

alternating least squares
- A ~ U_nk V_km, l(U, V) = 1/2 |Pi_Omega(A - UV)|^2 + lambda/2 (|U|^2 + |V|^2) 
    - polynomial of degree 4 in params of U and V
    - separate into subproblems in cols of V and rows of U
    - l_U(v_j) = 1/2 v_j^T (sum w_ij u_iu_i^T + lambda I)v_j - (sum w_ij a_ij u_i^T) v_j, solvable if U is given
- ALS: kind of EM
    - monotonically improves the objective and converges to a fixed point
