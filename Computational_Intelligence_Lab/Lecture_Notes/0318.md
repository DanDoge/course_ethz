### matrix completion

given sparse(-ly observed) matrix, fill in missnig entries
- a_ij ~ p, and I(a_ij, a_kl) = 0 -> ill posed problem
- conditional indepenence: given its row and column, a_ij independent to other things
- rating matrix and observation matix( in {0, 1})
    - centering: subtract row or col means
    - variance normalization
- minimal model
    - A ~ uv^t
    - u, v = argmin .5 |Pi_Omega (A - uv^t)|_F, project to observed values 
    - for 1*1 matrix: part l / part v = (uv-a) v, part l / part u = (uv-a) u
        - grad is 0 if uv = a or u=v=0
        - minima: hyperbola with two branches
        - for (0, 0) -Y saddle point
    - convexity -> matrix completion is not convex
        - Nabla^2 l(u, v) = (|v|^2, 2uv^t - A; (2uv^t - A)^t, |u|)
        - for m, n > 1 also not convex under some conditions
    - use ODE for gradient flow, assmue u=v
        - du/dt = -v(uv - 1)
        - d uv / dt = d u^2 / dt = -2uv(uv - a)
        - x(t) = a + (ax_0 - a^2) / (c exp(2at) + a - x_0)
- for fully observed rank1 model
    - l = (A - uv^t)^t (A - uv^t)
    = - tr(A^t uv^t), omit A^t A and assume u, v are unit vectors
    = - tr(u^t A v)
    - max(u^t A v) s.t. |u| = |v| = 1
    - lagrange multipliers: u = Av / |Av|
        - u propto AA^t u, v propto A^tA v
