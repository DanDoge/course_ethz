### introduction

AI? turing test -> not fully passed yet, can fool people for some while
- slove tasks commonly associated with intelligence
  - act intelligently(strong AI), not yet

topics
- prob foudations of AI
- Bayesian learning
- planning under uncertainty
- deep reinforcement learning
- applications

session exam, course project, six ungraded homeworks, exercise

### recap probability

prob: prob space, atomic events, non-atomic events, prob measure
- axioms, normaliyation, non-negative, sigma additivity
- frequentist interpretation
- bayesian interpretation, p(A) as a degree of belief
  - where does the prior come from

random variable
- mapping from event space to a set
- distribution on RV
- joint distributions
- conditional distribution
  - posterior inference
  - Bayesian
  - (conditional) dependence

problems with high dim distributions
- suppose n binary vars -> 2^n - 1 parameters
- marginals/conditional also hard to sum
- multivariate Gaussian -> only n^2 params to estimate
  - independent <-> uncorrelated
  - conditional distribution mu_(A|B) = mu_A + Sigma_AB Sigma_BB ^-1 (x_B - mu_B), Sigma_(A|B) = Sigma_(AA) - Sigma_(AB) Sigma_(BB)^(-1)Sigma_(BA)
    - note that the sigma will always go down
    - also note that the sigma does not depends on that x_B are observed
- inverse of covariance matrix is precision matrix
- multiple of Gaussian is also Gaussian
