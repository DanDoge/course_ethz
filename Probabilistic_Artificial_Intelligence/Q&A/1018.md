# questions

choose kernels on marginal ll, but cross validation is not replaced
- check for the best parameter using k fold -> to do
  - averaging 10 model parameters seems not legit
  - choose the best one on the validation?

selecting representative points: K-means/grid-sample
- some general answers
- but GP is more accurate where we have more data

desicion theory: unsymmetric cost function
- sample, but some simple intuition works

why my score is low?
- as long as the baseline is passed, anything is fine
- the packages also implicitly helped
