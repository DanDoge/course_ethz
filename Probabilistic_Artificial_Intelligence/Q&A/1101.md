### proj 1

scaled Matern kernel(v = 1.5) and White Noise
- set noise to zero for evaluation
- min expected (custom) cost
  - integration on truncated Gaussians, by looking up mean and variances
- assume locality, train multiple smaller models
  - cluster to 30 different (overlapping) regions, BLUE estimator to mix multiple estimates
