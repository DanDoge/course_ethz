### recap prob

prob
- frequentist lim #event happens / N
- subjective: a (consistent) belief(distribution)
  - prior --event--> posterior
- prob space, (omega, F, P)
  - omega: unit event
  - F: subset of omega, sigma(countable operations)-algebra
    - also called information: limits the outcome of the experiment, s.t. some outcome of omega are not considered, or some outcomes can nout be distinguished
  - P: assign value to F
- random var: omega -> R
  - get some number out of the omega
  - x should be F_measureable: inverse of x is F
- change of variable
  - p_g(g(x)) = p_x(x) |det g^-1(x)|
  - what about 2dim case, (x,y) to (r,theta)
    - generally, p(y) = p(x) |dx / dy|
- law of unconscious statistician
  - E g(x) = int g(x) f(x) dx
- conditional expectation
  - E(X | Y) is a RV w.r.t. y
  - E(E(X | Y)) is EX: total prob formular
  - what about E(X | F\`): given the information of F\`, what is the expectation of X
- trick: X = sum of X A_i s.t.  A_i are a partition of omega

gaussian vector
- if any lin comb of x_i are normally distributed, x_i is gaussian vector
- cov matrix are always psd
  - A = QQ^T, Q is U^T lambda^1/2
  - level set of a quaduatic form is always ellipsis
