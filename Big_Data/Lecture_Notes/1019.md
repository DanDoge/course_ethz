### wide col stores

HBase is fast even on HDFS, why? -- shortcircuit datanode

problem: only able to write in sorted order
- tree structure in memstore
- flush to HFile if mem is full, O(n) time for write
  - or log is full
- write-ahead log(HLog), sorted by time
- read: from everywhere
- compaction: merge things, linear again

log structured merge trees
- throughput oriented/bounded
- whereas in RDBMS, B+ tree, seek time bound
