### performance at large scales

avoid memory scale up
- unused fields, data structures, redundancy, inheritance and RTTI
- avoid CPU: method calls, avoid class hierarchies/overriden methods, casting, exception
- avoid distIO: efficient format, compression
- avoid network: batch process, pushdown: pre-filter/project/aggregate
  - e.g. do counting in the sender

sweetspot of recourse allocation: not too much, not too little
- smaller chunks: remove tail latency

### data cubes

OLAP: online analytical processing
- databased decision support, lot of reads, large portions of data, many joins, few long heavy queries, slow interactive
  - redundant does not matter, as long as read is good
- OLTP: transaction
  - at higher normal form for consistency
- non-volatile, integrated
- ETL: extract, transform, load

Data model: cubes, traditionally
- cube of facts: 3 or more coordinates, one per axis/dimension
- or fact table view
- slicing: take a ax and fix a coordinate
- dicing: display 2-dim things not as a table but a square
  - slicer / dicer: axes used for slicing or dicing
- aggregation
  - merge things along a dimension, e.g. summation
- dimension as a tree of members
  - roll-up: depth-constrained veiw of aggregating
  - drilling down: inverse of roll-up

implementation
- pivoting/unpoviting
- star schema/snow flake schema
  - one row per fact
- query cubes
  - MDX: multi dimentional expression, logical language
    - select [] on columns [] on rows from [] where 
  - SQL: physical level
    - select from where
    - slicing: where
    - rolling up: group by things that are not rolled up
    - drilling down: group by more things
    - materializing all aggregates: precomputing things
      - group by grouping sets()
      - group by cube(), 2^n
      - group by rollup(), n + 1
