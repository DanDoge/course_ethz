### wide column stores

data models: still physical data model
- relational databases issues: small scale, single machine
- scale out: cluster, replicate --> hard to set up, 
- HBase: on top of HDFS
- big table
  - tabular thing: expensive joins
  - denormalize things: things accessed together are stored together
    - and now we have a lot of columns
  - row with rowId: sorted
  - columns with family: originates from the same table
    - can be added on the fly
  - everything is binary
  - 10mb per cell would be the sweet spot
  - query
    - get a row with rowId
    - put
    - scan: some rows and some 
      - cannot do on dynamoDB(after hashing of keys)
    - delete

wide column stores: bigtable, hbase, cassandra
- column families intersect rowId region stored together
- Hmaster - RegionServer
  - two processes from the same machine
- Hmaster
  - assign regions to regionservers
  - split too big regions, and rebalance things
- regionserver: serving requests
- store: HFile on HDFS
  - seq. of k-v pairs, keylength(32b), valuelength(32b), key, value
    - key: rowlength, row, col family, col qualifier, timestamp, keytype
    - finding a key in HFile, further divide into HBlocks, and find the block and then key
  - also has versioning
- row level ACID, lock per row
- table - regions - stores - HFiles - key values
