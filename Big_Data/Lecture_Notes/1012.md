### syntax

xml1.0 -- 1.1: very little, change of unicode and end of lines

well-formed entity reference: &-64 is not 
- &#: base 10, &#x20: base 16

Qname(qualified name): prefix, loclaname, namespace
- prefix does not matter --> two qname with only diff. qname will be equal
- default namespace: <absent> bind to this namespace, anything w/o prefix belongs here
  - but it is not the same with documet w/o namespace at all, which has no ns
- clean practices
  - no ns at all, one default ns, one prefixed ns, multiple prefixed ns
- unprefixed attr does not fall into namespace, but prefixed ones work as normal
- in text &dslhgk is usually not defined, <!-- not -- in the middle -->
