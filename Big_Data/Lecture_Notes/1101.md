### data models

jsound
- document/instance, schema
  - schema: "key" : "string"/"integer"/"null"/"item"(i.e. anythings)/[ "item" ](array of things) / [{"key" : "some type"}]
    - optional by default
    - array length can be 0
  - "!key": required fields
  - expert mode: kind, baseType, content, closed(allow other things)
    - kind: atomic, object, array things
    - baseType: OOP-ish things
  - schema as a json file is static, with closed=True, (meta-schema-ish things)

json schema
- types: limited
- by default closed
- { } or true for anything
- type : [type1, type2]
- "key": false to probit something


xml schema
- type "xs:string"
- in the instance use xsi:nosoemthing="xmlschemafile"
- mixed="true", mix of things
- declare types with name, and use it later with type
- minOccurs=1 by default
