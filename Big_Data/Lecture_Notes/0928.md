### key value storage

object storage is not database(are datalake)
- large latency

key value store(Dynamo)
- lower latency, smaller objects, no metadata
- basic API
  - get(key) --> value, context
  - put(key, context, value)
- write extensive system
- principles: incremental stability, symmetry, decentralization, heterogeneity
  - p2p network
  - distributed hash table: chord, hash id as a ring
  - id stored at next node clockwise
  - adding/removing nodes: duplication, 2/n ranges
  - finger tables: who is responsible for some key
    - dynamo: preference lists, first node is coordinator
      - read from at least R nodes, write with confirmation forom W nodes, R + W > N
  - virtual nodes(token), each phythic machine for several virtual tokens
    - then assign tokens to machines when they join/leave
  - vector clocks: partial order
    - value, (node, time), by default time=0 for all other nodes
    - gather all versions for return
    - not atomically consistant
