### distributed file systems

order: reflective, transitive, antisymmetric

hdfs: not patrition torlarent
- single point of failure: namenode
  - recover from shutdown: block location not lost, namespace and file2block is stored in namespace file(network attached file, not on hdfs), edit log after this snapshot, and load from this file after crash
    - do a new napespace file when edit log is long
  - standby namenode, maintain mappings and locations in mem like the namenode
    - datanode send information to all namenodes
  - observer namenode: some got permoted to this, for read access only
    - consistency: client get a timestamp when writing, observer namenode will up-to-this-date
  - federated DFS namenode the a subnamespace
- using hdfs: hadoop fs <args>, 
  - unix things, or -copyFromLocal localfile hadooppath, -copyToLocal hadoopfile local path
