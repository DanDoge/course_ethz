### map reduce

1000 node cluster --> run overnight

### spark

problem: jobtracker(scheduling and monitoring, bottleneck!)
- non fungile: map/reduce slot being idle

YARN
- job --> resource manager --> monitoring go to a container
- application manager asking for resources, get several containers, and monitoring these things
- scheduling / monitoring separated
  - so restart also is up to application master
- also with heart beats
