### graph db

RDF/triple stores
- triple as first class citizen: subject --property-- object
- IRI as subject and object and edges
  - or literals
  - property can only be IRI
  - subejct cannot be literals(XML types)
  - in generalized graph everything is allowed
- blank node: defined by the relationship

syntaxes:

turtle
- qname: only as a shorter version of prefix
- semicolon and comma

json-ld
- context, id(subject factored out)

xml
- full iri in rdf:resources

query: sparql

SELECT ?s
WHERE {
    ?s relationship ?o
    ?o relationship2 object
}
- define variable by ?

RDF schema
- set of class and property
- adding <rdf:type rdf:resource="IRI">
  - or replace the rdf:type thing

### performance at large scales

bottleneck
- memory/CPU/desk/network
  - exactly one of the four
- diskIO: go to cluster
- measurement: latency/throughput
- speedup: latency_old / latency_now
- amdahl law: 1/(1 - p + p/s) 
  - for constant problem size, smaller time
  - or 1 - p + sp? for constant computing power, more problems
