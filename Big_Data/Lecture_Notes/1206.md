### graph databases

k-v store: low level
- document and triple are higher
- SQL: foreign k --> primay k, cannot do reverse

graph db
- index free adjacency
- families: property graph, triple stores
- solutions: native or not
- representation: incidence matrix
- labeled property graph
  - property on nodes and edges
    - property on node: a row in RDBMS, but keys can repeat, cannot nest things
    - property on edges: relationship tables: from to, and other values
  - label on nodes: multiple possible, label as name of table in RDBMS, schema is optional
  - relationship types(names), exactly one per edge

schema
- type system: adding Node, Relationship, Path
  - homogenious array is allowed, otherwise it is a valid SQL table
  - map is not allowed in Neo4j

Cypher query
- a path template/patterns
- (alpha {name: 'foobar'}) -[:A]-> (beta:yellow) -[:B]-> (gamma: blue {name : 'barfoo'}) <-[:B]- (delta) -[:B]-> (alpha)
- (alpha) -[*1..4]-> (beta)
  - label or k-v query, and also edge type query
  - cycle is allowed
  - path length constraints

MATCH ascii art
WITH foo as bar
WHERE alpha.name = 'foobar'
RETURN gamma
ORDER BY, LIMIT
- where can be inlined

CREATE(add new things), MERGE(if already there, only extend)

Neo4j arch
- primary node and secondary nodes: full copy and sync.ed
  - read scale-up
  - write to core or replica
- sharding: are there only recently
- storage
  - linked list of labels and kv pairs and edges(double linked, one for incoming and one for outgoing)
  - 4 pointers to prev./next edge for src/tgt, and 2 linked to src/tgt
  - on dist: list of node/relation/property/label things, fixed length
