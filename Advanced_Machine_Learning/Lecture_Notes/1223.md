### PAC learning

PAC
- efficient PAC learning: if A runs in poly(1/eps, 1/delta)
- for finite C, P(r(c) - inf r(c) > eps) <= 2|C|exp(-2neps^2)
- for infinite C, lhs <= 9 n^VC exp(-n eps^2 / 32)
    - set shattered by a concept class if every subset S in A, exists a concept c in C s.t. S = c_s intersect A
    - VC dimention: largest size of set of elements that can be shattered by C
- strong PAC learning: demand arbitrarily small error w.h.p. 1 - delta
- weak PAC learning: lhs holds for large enough eps
