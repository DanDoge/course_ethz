### representations

data
- measurement: mapping from the object set to a domain
  - feature vectors/monadic data: note the correlations
  - proximity data: also note the space objects lies in 
- type of outputs
  - nominal/categorial, ordinal, quantitative(interval(relation carries informations), ratio(where zero carries informations))
    - also associated with some transformation invarances resp.
  - data whitening: normalize by the standard deviation
- mathematical spaces: refer to slides

### density estimation

bayesian view
- both the observations (X, Y) and paramterers are random variables
- parametric statistics: P(X, Y | theta) is a priori known
- while non parametric statistics estimates likelihood by sampling
- SLT: min. Â£(empirical) risk w/o likelihood
- why prior when we have big data? model complexity also grows
- e.g. graph coloring
  - data: all graph with edge weights R^(n, 2)
  - hypothesis class: R^n
