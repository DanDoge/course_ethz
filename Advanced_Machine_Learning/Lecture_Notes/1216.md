### sampling

approximate E_theta~p f(theta)
- approx= 1/M sum of f(theta_t), theta_i ~ p
- MCMC sampling
    - theta_t ~ pi(theta | theta_t-1)
    - if G_pi is connected, theta_t is aperiodic, detailed balance
        - then lim_t p(theta_t) = p(theta)
- Gibbs sampling
    - sample a coord at a time
- Rao-Blackwellization
    - theta and z are r.v. with p(theta, z), f(theta, z) are of interest
    - E f(theta | z) = E_z E_theta f(theta, z) ~ 1/M sum of f(theta, z) z ~ p(z), theta ~ p(theta | z)
    - (Rao-Blackwell) Var_z E_theta f(theta, z) <= Var_theta,z f(theta, z)
