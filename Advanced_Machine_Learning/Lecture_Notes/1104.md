### convex optimazation and SVM

maximum margin classifier
- more stable than perceptron
- max. margin (distance from the separating hyperplane) s.t. all x are classified correctly
- review convex optimization
    - min f(w) s.t. g(w) = 0, h(w) < 0, assume f is convex and solution from f, h is a convex shape
    - Lagrangian L = f + lambda g + alpha h, alpha > 0
        - check Slater's condition, exists g = 0 and h < 0
        - solve for part L / w = 0, g = 0, h <= 0, alpha >= 0, alpha h = 0
    - convex optimization via the dual
        - min f, s.t. g = 0, h <= 0
        - define the dual max theta(lambda, alpha), s.t. alpha >= 0
            - theta(lambda, alpha) = min_w L(w, lambda, alpha)
            - weak duality, the dual < primal
        - if Slater's condition holds, optimal value coincide
            - complementary slackness: alpha h = 0
            - w* = argmin_w L(w, lambda*, alpha*)
