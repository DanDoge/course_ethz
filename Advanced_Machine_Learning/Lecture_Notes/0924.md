### intro cont`d

human know to solve: design algorithm and engineering
- can solve bot do not know: supervised learning
- cannot solve: autonomous learning(self-play) / unsupervised learning
  - suspect data and then make hypothesis: if data lays on low dim estimation do dim reduction, if data clusters, do clustering -> precondition of the data
  - suppose we do dim reduction: assume reproducibility and information theory
    - examples, to be filled
  
  ethics
  - privacy and personalized medicine
  - material and immaterial values
  - legal resonsibility
  - plausability and complexity
  - prejudices and fairness

  scientific method
  - questions
  - hypothesis
  - experiment
  - analyze
  - theory

  paradigm shift in human htought
  - self-learning machines generate knowledge without huamn brains by data science
