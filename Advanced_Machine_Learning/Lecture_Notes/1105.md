### SVM

for feasible w, min L(w, lambda, alpha) < min f(w)
- for all w inf L(w, lambda, alpha) < min_feasible_w L(w, lambda, alpha)
- max_lambda_alpha inf L(w, lambda, alpha) < min_feasible_w L(w, lambda, alpha)
- strong duality
    - f(w*) = theta(lambda*, alpha*) = inf_w L(w, lambda*, alpha*)
    <= L(w*, lambda*, alpha*) <= f(w*)
    - consequences w* = argmin L(w, lambda*, alpha*), alpha h = 0
- primal for SVM is intractable in high/infty dim., and optimal up to a scaling of w
    - w* = sum alpha y x, a (sparse) linear combination of support vectors
    - w_0* from support vectors
- soft margin SVM
    - higher C leads to narrow margin, few neglected samples
    - neglected samples also count as support vectors
