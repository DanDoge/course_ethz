### nonlinear SVMs

for soft margin SVM: a_i > = for all support vectors
- a_i = 0: x_i lies on correct side of margin, a_i in (0, C): on the margin, a_i = C: x_i is wrongly classified

kernel
- requires two concepts: identity and similarity(local extension of identity)
    - dissimilarity(x, y) = sim(x, x) + sim(y, y) - 2sim(x, y)
    - for RBF kernel k = exp(gamma * dist), increasing gamma
        - similarity is so low s.t. every point is faraway from each other
            - margin increaces, every point is a support vector

structural SVMs
- multiclass SVM: introduce a weight for all classes
    - w_z_i y_i - max_z w_z y_i >= margin
- strutural SVM
    - joint feature map psi(z, y)
    - rescale margin: w_z_i y_i - w_z y_i >= delta(z, z_i) - eps_i
