### representations

learning
- estimation of dependeicies from empirical data
- min. expected classification error while max. generalization
  - approx by empirical classification error and empirical generalization performance(from cross vcalidation)
- choise of loss functions
- conditional expected risk R(f | X)
  - total expected risk R(f) = E_X R(f | X)
  - note that empiricla test error is not expected risk
    - report mean and variance for the deviation from expected risk
