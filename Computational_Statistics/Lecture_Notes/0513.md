### tree

spliting criteria
- loss -sum p_k log p_k --> entropy
    - entropy loss after spliting: sum_node e p(x in R_e) (-sum p log p)
    - gini splitting:  sum_node e p(x in R_e) (sum_h p_h (1 - p_h))
        - **look up later**

### random forest

grow B trees(default B = 500)
- each tree is unpruned
- predictons are averaged
- each tree is grown on random bootstrap subsample
    - each split point is selected among random subset of variables
- out of bag estimation
    - y^hat_i = 1/B_out sum_b y^hat_ib, B_out is trees where sample i is not used
