### smoothing splines

alternative appriach
- m^hat = argmin sum (y_i - m(x_i))^2
    - m should be smooth
    - penalinze curvature of fit
- m^hat = argmin sum (y_i - m(x_i))^2 + lambda int m''^2(x) dx
- for lambda -> 0, m^hat will interpolate all data points
- lambda -> infty, m^hat linear least square estimate
- cubic splines
    - a_i + b_i x  + c_i x^2 + d_i x^3 if x in i-th interval
    -  knots being interval boundaries, where function is continuous, first, second derivative
        - outside the intervals, we can just set the curvature to zero, so the integral range does not matter
    - 4(n - 1) - 3(n - 2) - 2
        - 4 parameters per interval
        - at internal knots, set continuous, first, second derivatives to equal
        - two boundary points have 0 second order derivative
        - total n DoF
- the basis of n dim-space(B-spline) can be written
    - sol = linear superposition of elements in the B-spline basis
    - B_j(x) j in [1, ..., n]
    - m^hat(x) = sum beta^hat_j B_j(x)
    - beta^hat = argmin |y - Bbeta|^2, B_ij = B_j(x_i)
    - for n intervals we can let error to zero
    - beta^hat = argmin |y - Bbeta|^2 + lambda beta^t Omega beta
        - Omega_ij = int B_i''(x) B_j''(x)
        - so beta^t Omega beta is second derivative squared
    - beta^hat = (B^tB + lamdba Omega)^(-1) B^t y
- prediction is still linear smoother
    - y^hat = S y = B beta^hat # note we are regressing in B-spline space

spline = smooth.spline(x, y, spar = 0.5) % spar is somehow normed lambda in (0, 1)
