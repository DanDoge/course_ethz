### MARS

multivariate addaptive regression spline
- use piecewise linear spline basis
- for i in 1...p, d in R
    - (x_j - d)_+ = max(x_j - d, 0)
    - and can always combine (d - x_j)_+ to get a reflected pair
    - for n data points, we have n*p linear basis fucntions
- MARS g(x) = sum beta_m h_m(x)
    - fix h_m, learn beta_m
    - h_0(x) = 1
    - forward selection, start with h_0(x) = 1, fit beta^hat_0
        - for each step, seqrch for the best pair h_2r-1(x), h_2r(x)
            - h_2r-1(x) = h_l(x) * (x_i - d)_+
            - h_2r(x) = h_l(x) * (d - x_i)_+
            - h_l is some previous spline
            - s.t. the RSS is mim.ed
            - search r * p * n for h_l, x_i and d
    - backward pruning
        - remove some functions again, do it AFTER forward selection
    - CV to stop pruning

### neural networks

start with input -- hidden -- output
- g = f(alpha + W Phi(alpha' + W' x))
- Phi is the nonlinearality
    - sigmoid or relu
- f for regerssion often 1
- loss: -sum p_gt log p_model
