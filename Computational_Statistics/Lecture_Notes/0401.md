### bootstrap

double boot strap
- build 1 - alpha BS CI: p(theta in I*(1 - alpha)) = 1 - alpha
- but in reality p(theta in I*(1 - alpha)) = 1 - alpha + Delta
    - adjust to alpha' s.t. Delta is 0
    - estimate alpha' with second level of BS
- p(theta in theta^ +- z sd(theta*^hat)) is what we want
- p(theta^hat in theta*^hat +- z_1-alpha/2 sd(thet**^hat)) is what we estimate
    - go one level down for each quantity


```r
covered = numeric(B)
for (boot in 1:B){
    bootsample = sample(1:n, n, replace=TRUE)
    xb = X[bootsample]
    mub[boot] = g(xb)

    mubb = numeric(B)
    for (boot2 in 1:B){
        bootsample = sample(1:n, n, replace=TRUE)
        xbb = xb[bootsample]
        mubb[boot2] = g(xbb)
    }
    ci = g(xb) + c(-1, 1) * qnorm(0.975) * sd(mubb)
    covered[boot] = as.numeric(ci[1] < g(x) & ci[2] > g(x))

    # covered[boot] = (g(xb) - g(x)) / sd(mubb)
    # and set qnorm(1 - alpha/2) to match this histogram
    # and then use this alpha in g(x) + c(-1, 1) * qnorm(1 - alpha/2) * sd(mub)
}
mean(covered)
```

```r
# for parametric BS
muhat = mean(x)
sdhat = sd(X)
for (boot in 1:B){
    xb = rnorm(n, muhat, sdhat)
    mub[hat] = g(xb)
}

# what is the difference between these two?
2 * g(x) - quantile(mub, c(0.975, 0.025))
g(x) + c(-1, 1) * qnorm(0.995) sd(mub)
