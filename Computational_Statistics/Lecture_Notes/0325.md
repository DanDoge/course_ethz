### cross validation

CV goes wrong
- select features -> CV to find hyperparam.
    - during feature selection: all data are used
    - during CV only selected feature are used, the selected feature are already doing good on this set
    - CV can be optimistic
- outer CV
    - split data, select predictors only from training data

```r
ifelse(cond, true clause, false clause)
bucket_size <- floor(n / k)
random_indices <- sample(n) # a permutation
spline_fit_cv <- smooth.spline(x[-hold_out_idx], y[-hold_out_idx], spar = spar_vals[i])
y_pred <- predict(spline_fit_cv, xvals[hold_out_cv])$y

``` 

bootstrap
- sample iid from p
- from z_1...n estimate p
    - p = sum 1/n delta(z_i)
- GC theorem: this empirical distribution converges to p
