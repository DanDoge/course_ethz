### classification and regression tree

g_tree(x) = sum beta_r 1_{x in R_r}
- with union R_r = R^p, intersection being empty set
- beta_r min. loss function (e.g. nll, rss)
    - mean of the samples in the leaf node
    - perportion of elements in class k for classification problems
- split point cannot be extensively searched: (np)^k possibilities for k splits
    - partition / tre structure chosen in greddy fasion
    - root node, then try all possible split for all leaf nodes that min. the loss
    - backward pruning, stop using CV

```r

tree = rpart(Y ~ ., data=X)

plot(tree)

text(tree)

predict(tree) # for classification, gives prob for each classes

require(randomForest)

rf = randomForest(X, Y)
```
